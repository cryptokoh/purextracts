# 🎨 Icon Sizes - FIXED!

## Problem
SVG icons were rendering too large because their container divs (`.product-icon`, `.education-card-icon`, etc.) didn't have explicit CSS sizing rules.

## Solution
Added proper CSS sizing for all icon containers:

### Product Icons (Gummies, Tinctures, etc.)
- Container: 64x64px (56px on mobile)
- SVG: 32x32px (28px on mobile)
- Background: Primary color subtle
- Border radius: Large (xl)

### Education Card Icons
- Container: 56x56px (48px on mobile)
- SVG: 28x28px (24px on mobile)
- Background: Primary color subtle
- Border radius: Large (lg)

### About Feature Icons
- Container: 48x48px
- SVG: 24x24px
- Background: Primary color subtle
- Border radius: Medium (md)

### Trust Icons (Already Had Sizing)
- Container: 48x48px
- SVG: 24x24px

### Contact Icons (Already Had Sizing)
- Container: 56x56px
- SVG: 28px

## Logo SVG - Placeholder

**Yes, the logo is a placeholder!** The current logo is a simple inline SVG with a droplet/botanical design:

```svg
<svg viewBox="0 0 40 40" fill="none">
    <path d="M20 4C20 4 8 12 8 22C8 28.627..." opacity="0.2"/>
    <path d="M20 8C20 8 12 14 12 22C12 26.418..." opacity="0.4"/>
    <path d="M20 12C20 12 16 16 16 22C16 24.209..." />
</svg>
```

### How to Replace the Logo

**Option 1: Use an Image**
```html
<a href="index.html" class="nav-logo">
    <div class="logo-icon">
        <img src="/images/logo.png" alt="Pure Extracts TX" />
    </div>
    <span class="logo-text">Pure Extracts<span class="logo-suffix">TX</span></span>
</a>
```

**Option 2: Use Your Custom SVG**
Replace the SVG code in the `.logo-icon` div with your custom SVG logo.

**Option 3: Use Both (Icon + Wordmark)**
Keep the structure but replace the SVG with your logo icon, and the text stays.

For reference, these are industry-standard icon sizes:

2. Check product cards - icons should be nicely sized
3. Check education cards - icons should be proportional
4. Resize to mobile - icons should scale appropriately
5. All icons should have colored backgrounds and be centered
